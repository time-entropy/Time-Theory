# Time-Theory 

## From subjective perception to objective counting of state refresh


## Time in SR as a observer's perception
In the realm of Special Relativity (SR), the perception of time is inherently linked to the observer's frame of reference. The observation of physical processes across different frames fundamentally corresponds to the tracking of transformation events. Discrepancies in the measurement of time between observers arise from the accumulated differences in these transformation counts within their respective frames. While an observer can measure the differential transformation count Î”N of another frame, their own transformation count N0 remains imperceptible to them. This observed difference in transformation counts is primarily determined by the dynamic light-path disparity between the observer's frame and the moving frame of the measured object. Under the principle of the invariance of the speed of light, these counting operations naturally lead to the derivation of Lorentz-covariant rules.

## Time in GR  as gravitational or equivalence principle time modulation on proper time 
Contrastingly, GR introduces mechanisms involving gravitational time dilation, which entail actual alterations in the transformation frequency of the SEQ network. Additionally, the equivalence principle necessitates spatial compression considerations, further distinguishing it from SR phenomena.
